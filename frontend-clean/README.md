## Development Approach

This project follows a modular and component-based architecture, with each component having its own CSS file for better maintainability. The development approach includes:

1. **Component-Based Structure**: Each feature has its own directory with component and styling files
2. **Type Safety**: TypeScript is used throughout for better code quality and developer experience
3. **Clean UI**: Simple and intuitive user interface with consistent styling
4. **Optimized Performance**: Efficient rendering and code splitting for better user experience

## Future Enhancements

- Authentication and user role management
- API integration for real-time data
- Mobile responsiveness improvements
- Dark mode theme
- Advanced filtering and search capabilities
- Integration with other railway management systems
